# Art — Visual Intent

This folder contains a **curated set of visual references** for *Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel*.

The images included here are not final assets, gameplay screenshots, or production art.  
Their purpose is to communicate **tone, scale, environmental authority, and design intent**, in direct support of the conceptual and systemic documents of the project.

This folder is intentionally minimal and selective.

## Folder Structure

### 📁 `cover/`

Conceptual cover images used to establish the overall atmosphere and visual identity of the project.

Files:
- `cover-concept-1.png`
- `cover-concept-2.png`

These images function as **conceptual covers**, not as final key art or in-game representations.  
They are included to convey mood, scale, and thematic positioning.

---

### 📁 `concept-art/curated/`

A strictly curated selection of concept images chosen to reinforce core design principles.

Files:
- `concept-curated-1.png`
- `concept-curated-2.png`
- `concept-curated-4.webp`
- `concept-curated-5.webp`

These images emphasize:
- The dominance of the mountain over the human figure  
- Scale and solitude  
- Climate as a persistent condition rather than a dramatic event  
- Ambiguous routes and decision-making without explicit guidance  

They are meant to be read **in dialogue with the Design Pillars and Systems Overview**, not as standalone illustrations.

---

## What This Folder Is Not

- A complete archive of all generated concept art  
- A portfolio or visual showcase  
- A collection of production-ready assets  
- A depiction of final UI, mechanics, or gameplay moments  

All materials here are **referential**, not representative of final quality or scope.

---

## Intended Use

The visuals in this folder can be used to:
- Support reading and interpretation of the written design documents  
- Communicate tone and intent to collaborators or reviewers  
- Anchor discussions around scale, environment, and pacing  

They should **not** be interpreted as promises of visual fidelity or production style.

---

## Formats and Resolution

Images are provided in flattened formats (`.png`, `.webp`) and moderate resolutions.  
They are intentionally limited to discourage reuse as assets.

---

## Licensing

All images are included for contextual and referential purposes only.  
They may not be reused, redistributed, or repurposed outside this project.

For licensing details, see [`LICENSE.md`](../LICENSE.md).
