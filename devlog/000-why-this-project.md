# Devlog 000 — Why This Project Exists

This document explains **why this project exists**, and why I chose to work on it personally.

It is not a pitch, an announcement, or a record of achievements.  
It is a statement of intent grounded in lived experience and historical awareness.

## Why a Devlog

This devlog exists to document **decisions**, not just outcomes.

For this project, progress is not measured only through visible production such as code, assets, or features, but through:
- conceptual clarity  
- systemic coherence  
- decisions made explicit  
- ideas tested, refined, or deliberately discarded  

Writing is part of the development process.  
Thinking is part of the work.

This devlog records that work.

## Why This Project

I have visited the Aconcagua region several times over the years.

I have walked its access routes, spent time in its camps, observed its changes in weather and light, and experienced its scale not as an abstract idea, but as a physical and emotional reality. In January 2026, I participated in a successful expedition to the summit of Aconcagua via the 360 route (the Polish Traverse).

That experience is not the subject of this game.  
But it is the origin of it.

What stayed with me was not the summit itself, but the accumulation of decisions: when to wait, when to move, when to stop, when to turn back, how to read the mountain, how to listen to the body, and how often certainty was simply unavailable.

The mountain never felt like something to be conquered.  
It felt like something that had to be **read**.

## Beyond a Personal Experience

This project is also an opportunity to explore and share a broader cultural context.

Aconcagua is not an empty stage.  
It is a territory shaped by thousands of years of human presence, movement, belief, and practice.

Long before modern expeditions, routes, and camps, the mountain and its surrounding region were part of Andean cultures, including the Inca Empire, whose relationship with altitude, landscape, and ritual differed fundamentally from modern sporting approaches. Later came scientific expeditions, national projects, guides, porters, muleteers, rangers, and mountaineers from many traditions.

All of them contributed to what Aconcagua is today.

This project does not aim to recreate that history exhaustively, nor to turn it into a didactic catalogue.  
But it does aim to **acknowledge that the mountain has always been inhabited, traversed, and interpreted**, and that modern ascents exist within that longer continuum.

## What This Project Is Trying to Share

*Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* is my way of sharing both an experience and a context.

Not by reproducing the climb step by step, and not by turning it into spectacle or heroism, but by translating its **decision logic** into an interactive form, while remaining attentive to the cultural layers that surround the mountain.

The intention is to make the mountain legible to people who may never climb it, and to invite others to approach mountains—this one or others—in real life with curiosity, respect, and attention.

This includes:
- understanding uncertainty as a constant  
- recognizing limits as external and non-negotiable  
- seeing retreat as a valid and often necessary decision  
- acknowledging that mountains are not neutral spaces, but lived territories

## What This Project Is Exploring

This project explores:

- Decision-making with partial, noisy, and situated information  
- Progress without numerical leveling or power accumulation  
- Failure as information rather than punishment  
- Environment as an active system rather than a backdrop  
- Contemplation as a meaningful action  

It intentionally avoids:
- power fantasies  
- constant action loops  
- optimization-driven play  
- spectacle-first design  

The tension here does not come from danger, but from **responsibility under uncertainty**.

## Why This Approach

High-altitude mountaineering does not reward dominance.

It rewards judgment, patience, restraint, and awareness—of the environment, of the body, and of context. Often, it rewards the decision **not** to continue.

This project adopts that same logic.

Systems exist here to constrain rather than empower.  
Information is incomplete by design.  
Progress is slow, conditional, and sometimes undone.

This approach also leaves space for history and culture to be present **without being gamified**, as part of the world rather than as collectibles or checklists.

---

## What This Devlog Is (and Is Not)

This devlog **is**:
- a public record of design reasoning  
- a space for articulating constraints and trade-offs  
- a way to preserve coherence over time  

This devlog **is not**:
- a marketing channel  
- a feature roadmap  
- a promise of timelines or deliverables  
- a stream of constant updates  

Periods of silence do not imply inactivity.

---

## How Progress Is Measured Here

Progress is measured by:
- clearer design boundaries  
- fewer unresolved contradictions  
- systems that explain each other  
- decisions that reduce ambiguity  

Sometimes progress means choosing **not** to build something.

Those moments are considered successful outcomes.

## A Note on Visibility

Not all development stages are visually expressive.

Some phases produce:
- documents  
- diagrams  
- refinements that are invisible from the outside  
- decisions that only make sense in hindsight  

This devlog treats those phases as legitimate work.

---

## Closing Note

*Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* exists because some experiences—and some places—are difficult to communicate directly.

This project is my way of sharing what it feels like to make decisions in a territory shaped by altitude, history, culture, and limits imposed from the outside.

If it helps make Aconcagua, the Andean world around it, and mountains in general feel more legible, more human, and more worthy of respect, then it will have fulfilled its purpose.

Further devlog entries will document **how these ideas are translated into systems**.

Not how they are overcome.
