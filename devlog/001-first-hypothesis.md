# Devlog 001 — First Hypothesis

This document marks the transition from definition to validation.

Up to this point, the project has focused on establishing intent, boundaries, and internal coherence.  
From here onward, the project begins to test whether those principles can sustain a meaningful experience when reduced to their minimum expression.

This devlog does not introduce a new vision.  
It reorganizes, condenses, and deliberately puts at risk what has already been defined.

## 1. Synthesis of Work Completed So Far

At this stage, the project has reached a level of conceptual maturity that allows it to move beyond abstract exploration.

The following elements are considered **clearly defined and stable**:

- A coherent vision of the project as a **decision-driven, contemplative experience**
- A set of explicit design pillars governing tone, scope, and constraints
- A systemic framework centered on environment, body, resources, and information
- A deliberate rejection of action-driven, power-fantasy, and optimization-centric game models
- Clearly stated limits of simulation and intentional omissions

The project is no longer asking *what it wants to be*.  
It is now asking *whether what it wants to be can actually work*.

---

## 2. The Current Problem

The core challenge at this stage is no longer definitional.

It can be stated as follows:

> **The problem is not defining the game, but determining whether its principles can produce a meaningful experience when reduced to a minimal situation.**

This marks a shift from:
- definition → testing  
- articulation → validation  
- conceptual coherence → experiential coherence  

From this point forward, ideas must justify themselves through interaction, not description.

---

## 3. The Minimal Experience as a Hypothesis

The project’s **minimal experience definition** is treated here as a **design hypothesis**, not as a solution.

The hypothesis can be summarized as:

> *A meaningful sense of tension, responsibility, and engagement can emerge from slow decision-making under partial information, without explicit action, combat, or progression systems.*

### What This Hypothesis Attempts to Validate

- That tension can exist without immediate danger or spectacle
- That incomplete and noisy information leads to meaningful decisions
- That slow degradation and accumulation of consequences produce engagement rather than frustration
- That retreat, waiting, and inaction can feel purposeful

### What This Hypothesis Actively Engages

- Environmental constraints
- Limited information channels
- Persistent consequences
- Time as pressure rather than urgency

### What Is Explicitly Left Out

- Combat or adversarial systems
- Skill trees, leveling, or numerical power progression
- Complex narrative branching
- Visual polish or audiovisual feedback as a primary driver

This reduction is intentional.  
Anything not essential to validating the hypothesis is considered noise at this stage.

---

## 4. Objectives of This Stage

The objectives of this phase are specific and non-ambiguous.

This stage aims to:

- Validate whether tension emerges without explicit action mechanics
- Observe whether partial information leads to deliberation rather than confusion
- Test whether gradual degradation produces meaning instead of irritation
- Determine whether the decision to stop, wait, or retreat feels legitimate

Success at this stage does **not** mean that the experience is “fun” in a conventional sense.  
It means that the experience is **legible, coherent, and internally justified**.

---

## 5. Methodological Approach

To address these objectives, the project will proceed through **low-fidelity prototyping**.

### Type of Prototype

- Paper prototype or equivalent low-fidelity simulation
- Textual or turn-based representation
- Minimal interaction loop
- No reliance on real-time input or audiovisual polish

### Tools and Medium

- Tables, simple state variables, and decision prompts
- Possibly a lightweight digital scaffold (spreadsheet, simple script, or minimal engine setup)
- No commitment to a specific engine at this stage

### What Will Be Simulated

- Environmental conditions affecting decisions
- Partial and imperfect information
- Accumulating consequences over time

### What Will Be Abstracted

- Fine-grained physical simulation
- Detailed physiology
- Visual representation of space beyond symbolic scale

Iteration is expected to be frequent and inexpensive.  
Discarding versions is part of the process.

---

## 6. Validation Criteria

This hypothesis will be evaluated against observable signals.

### Indicators of Validity

- Players hesitate before making decisions
- Players can articulate *why* they chose to wait, advance, or retreat
- Decisions feel consequential even when outcomes are not immediately visible
- The absence of action does not collapse engagement

### Indicators of Structural Failure

- Decisions feel arbitrary or purely random
- Players default to a single dominant strategy
- Uncertainty feels confusing rather than interpretable
- The experience relies on imagined stakes rather than systemic ones

### What Can Be Adjusted

- Information presentation
- Rate of degradation
- Decision frequency

### What Cannot Be Compromised

- Environmental authority
- Partial information
- Persistence of consequences

If these core elements fail to produce meaning, the project’s foundation must be reconsidered.

## 7. Risks, Open Questions, and Deferred Decisions

This stage accepts the possibility of being wrong.

Identified risks include:
- Excessive abstraction leading to detachment
- Insufficient feedback producing disorientation
- Slow pacing being misread as lack of substance
- Over-reliance on player interpretation

Open questions remain regarding:
- The minimum amount of feedback required to sustain engagement
- How much uncertainty is tolerable before frustration emerges
- Whether this experience can scale beyond its minimal form

Several decisions are intentionally deferred:
- Visual style implementation
- Narrative framing beyond contextual presence
- Technical stack and production pipeline

These will be revisited only if the hypothesis proves viable.

---

## Closing Note

This devlog marks the point where *Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* stops explaining itself and begins to test itself.

From here on, progress will be measured by what survives contact with interaction.

This is the stage where the project accepts the risk of discovering that its core assumptions may be incomplete, flawed, or insufficient.

That risk is not a problem.

It is the purpose of this phase.
