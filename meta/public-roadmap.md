# Public Roadmap

This document presents a **high-level roadmap** for *Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel*.

It is not a schedule, a timeline, or a delivery plan.  
It is a **map of stages**, intended to make visible what has already been accomplished and what kind of work lies ahead.

Progress in this project is not measured by speed, but by **clarity, coherence, and alignment**.

---

## How to Read This Roadmap

- Each stage represents a **type of work**, not a duration.
- Stages are sequential in logic, but may partially overlap.
- Completion does not mean “finished forever”, but **stable enough to build upon**.
- This roadmap prioritizes **design maturity over production volume**.

---

## Stage 1 — Grounding the Project  
**Status: Completed**

> Establishing intent, scope, and conceptual boundaries.

This stage focused on answering a single question:  
**What kind of project is this, and what kind of project is it not?**

### Outcomes
- Concept document defining the core experience
- Design pillars establishing non-negotiable principles
- Explicit limits of simulation and scope
- Clear authorial position and intent
- Initial visual curation aligned with design goals

This stage ensures the project is **grounded** before any form of production begins.

---

## Stage 2 — Systemic Definition  
**Status: Completed**

> Translating experience into systems.

This stage focused on identifying the **systems required to support the intended experience**, without committing to technical implementation.

### Outcomes
- Systems overview defining core interacting systems
- Clear decision loops and consequence logic
- Separation between environment, body, resources, and information
- Coherent relationship between uncertainty, progression, and agency

At the end of this stage, the project can be **reasoned about as a system**, not just described conceptually.

---

## Stage 3 — Visual Intent and Curation  
**Status: Completed**

> Establishing tone and scale through restraint.

This stage focused on defining **how the project should be seen**, without letting visuals lead design decisions.

### Outcomes
- Curated concept art selection with explicit criteria
- Visual materials aligned with environmental authority and scale
- Clear separation between reference imagery and production assets
- Art documentation designed to support, not replace, written design

The visual identity is **anchored**, not exploratory.

---

## Stage 4 — Prototyping the Core Experience  
**Status: Next**

> Testing decisions before building systems.

This stage focuses on validating the design through **paper prototypes and low-fidelity simulations**.

### Focus
- Decision-making under partial information
- Environmental constraints as active forces
- Consequences that persist and inform future choices
- Retreat and inaction as valid outcomes

The goal is not polish, but **proof of coherence**.

---

## Stage 5 — Selective System Prototyping  
**Status: Planned**

> Moving from abstract systems to concrete interactions.

This stage involves choosing **one or two core systems** and implementing them at minimal technical fidelity.

### Focus
- One system at a time
- Minimal interface
- No visual polish
- Behavior over appearance

This stage tests **whether the systems behave as intended**, not whether they look good.

---

## Stage 6 — Integrated Prototype  
**Status: Planned**

> Combining systems into a single playable structure.

At this stage, multiple systems interact in a constrained environment.

### Focus
- Cross-system feedback
- Emergent decision pressure
- Information legibility
- Failure modes and recovery

This is the first moment where the project becomes **holistically playable**, even if incomplete.

---

## Stage 7 — Evaluation and Direction Lock  
**Status: Planned**

> Deciding what this project will become.

This stage is explicitly evaluative.

### Possible Outcomes
- Proceed toward full development
- Re-scope the project
- Pause or archive with documentation
- Prepare for external collaboration or funding

Choosing **not** to proceed is considered a valid and successful outcome if coherence cannot be maintained.

---

## Final Note

This roadmap reflects a deliberate approach to development.

Significant progress has already occurred, even if it is not immediately visible as code or gameplay.  
The foundation is now strong enough to support experimentation without losing direction.

*Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* is not built to race forward, but to **advance with awareness**.
