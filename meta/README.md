# /meta — Project Meta Documentation

This directory contains the **foundational and strategic documents** for **Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel**.

It does not host technical documentation or implementation details.  
Instead, it defines the **conceptual framework, vision, high-level decisions, and guiding criteria** of the project.

If you want to understand *what this project is*, *why it exists*, and *from which principles it is being built*, this is the right place to start.

## What belongs in `/meta/`?

Documents in `/meta/` serve one or more of the following purposes:

- Define the **intent and meaning** of the project  
- Make **foundational decisions explicit**  
- Establish **principles, limits, and criteria**  
- Provide a **clear entry point** for external readers  
- Support conversations with collaborators, juries, investors, or institutions  

These documents are **public, versioned, and intentionally non-technical**.

## Core documents

### 📄 Project Whitepaper
**File:** [`project-whitepaper.md`](./project-whitepaper.md)

The central document of the project.  
It articulates the vision, design principles, conceptual framework, and foundational decisions behind **Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel**.

👉 **This is the recommended entry point to the project.**

---

### 🧭 Public Roadmap
**File:** [`public-roadmap.md`](./public-roadmap.md)

A public, high-level roadmap.  
It outlines the **stages of the project** and the type of work expected at each stage, without committing to dates or technical promises.

It complements the whitepaper by addressing the *how* and *in what order*, while the whitepaper focuses on the *why*.

## What you will NOT find in `/meta/`

To avoid confusion, this directory does **not** contain:

- technical documentation  
- detailed GDDs  
- system specifications  
- full narrative scripts  
- visual assets  
- source code  

That material lives (or will live) elsewhere in the repository, such as:

- [`/docs/`](../docs/) — design, systems, narrative, research  
- [`/art/`](../art/) — visual references and art direction  

---

## On the “living” nature of these documents

Documents in `/meta/` are **living documents**.  
They are updated when structural aspects of the project change, for example:

- redefinition of core design principles  
- significant scope changes  
- relevant learnings from prototyping  
- new ethical or cultural decisions  

Each document includes its own versioning and contextual notes.

---

## In summary

Think of `/meta/` as:

- the **conceptual backbone** of the project  
- the place where *what kind of game this is* is made explicit  
- the foundation upon which all other work is built  

If something important changes in the project, **it should be reflected here first**.
