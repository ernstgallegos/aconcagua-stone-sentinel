# Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel

**A narrative–systemic indie game about limits, environment, and the decision to continue.**

*Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* is an indie, single-player game inspired by the real ascent of Mount Aconcagua. It proposes a slow, deliberate, and systems-driven experience in which the player does not conquer the mountain, but learns to read it, adapt to it, and decide when advancing is no longer the right choice.

Reaching the summit is only one of several valid outcomes.

## One-Sentence Pitch

A narrative and systemic indie game that recreates the ascent of Aconcagua through realism-driven mechanics, where the player manages body, climate, and environment to decide how far to go.

---

## Core Idea

The mountain is the central system and the highest authority.

Geography, altitude, weather, and physical limits actively shape every decision. Progress does not emerge from leveling up or acquiring abstract attributes, but from learning how to interpret signals, manage risk, and recognize boundaries.

Uncertainty, partial information, and irreversible consequences are core elements of the experience.

---

## Design Pillars

_Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel_ is designed as a systemic experience.

Climate, terrain, equipment and the player’s physical and mental condition interact through feedback loops, shaping risk, adaptation and decision-making over time.

### 1. The Mountain Governs
Altitude, terrain, and climate are active systems that condition every action. The game design adapts to real geography rather than abstract level design.

### 2. Partial Information
The player accesses physiological and environmental data through a limited, diegetic interface (a watch-like device). Certainty is never absolute.

### 3. Learning by Doing
There are no levels or character attributes. Progression emerges from observation, experience, and informed decision-making under changing conditions.

### 4. Active Contemplation
Observation, pauses, and environmental awareness are not interruptions but core mechanics. Silence, scale, and time are meaningful design elements.

## What This Game Is Not

- Not an action game  
- Not a technical mountaineering simulator  
- Not a heroic power fantasy  
- Not a survival game focused on crafting loops  

Realism is expressed through systems and mechanics, not through technical spectacle or excessive simulation.

---

## High-Level Progression Structure

1. **Normal Route — Assisted Expedition**  
   Introduction to systems with logistical support and buffered consequences.

2. **Less Assisted Ascents**  
   Increased autonomy, critical decisions, and direct consequences.

3. **Solo Mode — Extreme Technical Route**  
   Full autonomy, no assistance, and no guarantees. The definitive experience.

## Legal and Ethical Framework

- The real geography of Mount Aconcagua and its main routes is represented faithfully.
- No real people, brands, or commercial entities are depicted.
- Historical and cultural elements are treated with a documentary, non-promotional approach.
- Risk and death are not romanticized.
- The game does not force the player to reach the summit.

Turning back, stopping, or failing are valid and meaningful outcomes.

*Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel explores the idea that advancing does not always mean progressing, and that recognizing limits—external and internal—can be a form of success.*
