# Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel  
## Concept Document

---

## 1. Working Title

**Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel**

Final project title.  
It refers to a real territory and to the ideas of trial, limit, and permanence. It works in both Spanish and English without the need for adaptation.

---

## 2. One-Sentence Pitch

A narrative and systemic video game that recreates the ascent of Mount Aconcagua through realism-driven mechanics, where the player manages body, climate, and environment to decide how far to continue.

---

## 3. Logline

In *Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel*, the player initially takes part in an assisted expedition along the Normal Route, where they learn the explicit and implicit rules of high-altitude mountaineering. As experience is gained, the player gains access to less mediated ascents and alternative routes, eventually facing the final attempt: a solo ascent via an extreme technical route, carrying all equipment and without external assistance. Reaching the summit is only one of several possible outcomes.

---

## 4. Genre and Form

- Indie single-player video game  
- Narrative experience driven by systems  
- Slow and deliberate pacing  
- Contemplative approach with constant tension  

This is not an action game nor a technical simulator. It relies on real-world rules to build a situated experience, where the central conflict emerges from the relationship between the body, the environment, and the passage of time.

---

## 5. Core Idea

The mountain is not a setting: it is the central system and the highest authority.

Geography, altitude, weather, and physical limits actively shape every decision. Progress is not expressed through levels or statistics, but through the player’s ability to read the environment, interpret signals, and recognize limits.

Uncertainty, partial information, and irreversible consequences are structural elements of the experience.

---

## 6. Target Audience and Market Context

*Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* is designed for a global segment of players drawn to contemplative, author-driven experiences—games that privilege atmosphere, meaning, and reflection over action intensity or mechanical mastery.

### Primary Audience
- Players of narrative and simulation-oriented indie games  
- People interested in deep, unconventional, author-led experiences  
- Players who value slow pacing, ambiguity, restraint, and systemic coherence

### Secondary Audience
- People interested in nature, mountaineering, and environmental learning  
- Outdoor communities looking for respectful, informed representations  
- Players who enjoy discovery through observation (journals, logs, field notes, collectibles with meaning)

### Market Characteristics (relevant to scope and production choices)
The market for contemplative narrative indie games is niche in volume, but mature in visibility and longevity. These titles typically:
- Maintain long commercial tails through digital discovery and word-of-mouth  
- Circulate through festivals, showcases, curator programs, and cultural press  
- Benefit more from identity and coherence than from feature accumulation  
- Attract players who often come from broader cultural consumption (film, literature, documentary, slow media), not only from traditional “hardcore” gaming

For this audience, realism is not expected as graphical spectacle, but as systemic credibility: decisions should feel grounded, constraints should be meaningful, and the world should respond consistently.

The project aims for a broad international reach while maintaining verisimilitude and respect for the accumulated knowledge of those familiar with the mountain. In this context, Aconcagua is not a generic backdrop: it operates as a symbolic and experiential anchor—scale, silence, risk, time dilation, and the negotiation with limits.

---

## 7. Value Proposition

- The mountain operates as a sovereign system, not as a scenic backdrop  
- Realism is built through mechanics, not graphical spectacle  
- The interface is diegetic, limited, and functional  
- Progression emerges from player experience rather than statistics  
- Failure is a possible, legitimate, and narratively meaningful outcome  

These choices respond directly to an audience that values coherence, restraint, and authorship, and that seeks experiences where reflection and interpretation are as important as progression or achievement.

## 8. Design Pillars

### Pillar 1 — The Mountain Governs  
Geography, altitude, and climate are active systems that condition every action. Design adapts to the real territory, not the other way around.

### Pillar 2 — Partial Information  
The player accesses physiological and environmental data through a limited device (similar to a sports watch). There are no absolute certainties or omniscient indicators.

### Pillar 3 — Learning by Doing  
There are no levels or attributes. Progress emerges from observation, signal interpretation, and informed decision-making under changing conditions.

### Pillar 4 — Active Contemplation  
Observing, stopping, and registering the environment are central actions, not interruptions. Silence, scale, and time are part of the game’s language.

---

## 9. Core Mechanics

- Movement affected by altitude, weight, terrain, and weather  
- Conscious management of water, food, and rest  
- Physiological system based on heart rate and oxygen saturation  
- Dynamic and probabilistic weather system  
- Equipment with real weight transported between camps  
- Observational logging of flora and fauna as an educational and contemplative system  

---

## 10. Progression Structure

1. **Normal Route — Assisted Expedition**  
   Introduction to systems with logistical support and buffered consequences.

2. **Less Assisted Ascents**  
   Greater autonomy, critical decisions, and direct consequences.

3. **Solo Mode — Extreme Technical Route**  
   Total autonomy, no assistance, no guarantees. The definitive experience.

Each stage does not represent a “level” overcome, but an increase in the player’s responsibility toward the environment.

---

## 11. Tone and Aesthetic

- Austere realism  
- Scale that emphasizes human fragility  
- Use of silence and environmental sound  
- Minimal and contextual music  

The approach prioritizes presence and scale over epic spectacle.

---

## 12. Legal and Narrative Boundaries

### Legal Boundaries
- Faithful representation of the Mount Aconcagua area and its main routes  
- Use of real geography without commercial brands or identifiable individuals  
- Historical and cultural elements treated with a documentary, non-promotional approach  

### Narrative Boundaries
- No heroic fantasy or special powers  
- Risk and death are not romanticized  
- The game does not force the player to reach the summit  

---

## 13. Project Scope

- Author-driven indie development  
- First objective: a playable vertical slice  
- Project prepared for presentation to funds, competitions, and indie publishers  
- Scalable by layers, not by artificial complexity  

Scope is deliberately defined to avoid inflating technical or narrative expectations.  
Scope decisions are informed not only by production constraints, but by the expectations of the contemplative indie market, where focus, coherence, and depth are valued over feature accumulation.

---

## 14. Audience Fit and Cultural Positioning

*Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* does not compete for mass-market volume. It competes for resonance, identity, and long-term discovery.

Its most natural channels of visibility are:
- Indie festivals and showcases  
- Curatorial selections (platform features, cultural programs)  
- Press and critics interested in authored experiences  
- Communities invested in nature, expedition culture, and environmental meaning  

Positioned as a project from Argentina with a real-world anchor, the game can function as both:
- A culturally exportable authored work  
- A systemic experience grounded in a specific geography and knowledge tradition  

This positioning supports the project’s funding readiness and reduces the need for blockbuster scale to achieve meaningful impact.

---

## 15. Context and Meaning

In a cultural context shaped by performance logic, acceleration, and the epic of success, *Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* proposes an experience in which recognizing limits and knowing when to stop is also a way of moving forward.

The mountain is not conquered: it is traversed, interpreted, and sometimes abandoned.

---

## 16. Final Statement

*Aconcagua: Stone Sentinel* proposes an experience where advancing does not necessarily mean progressing. The game is structured around reading the environment, recognizing limits—both external and internal—and accepting that returning safely can also be a valid resolution.

The true summit is not always at the top.
